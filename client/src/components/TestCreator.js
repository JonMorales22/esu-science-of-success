      creates the forms needed to gather data about questions and trials from the researcher.
      Since questions are embeded in trials, we essentiall have a 2d array (dimensions are 5x4 in default case).
      Unfortunatly, the data doesn't allow for me to manipulate it easliy as a 2d array, 
      so the data is a 1d array but we're treating it as a 2d array.
      I use one loop to create the trials, then I embed another loop to create the questions.
      This seems extremely convoluted, there's probably a much better way to accomplish this. but whatevs, i'll fix later (famous last words)
